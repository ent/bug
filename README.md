# Template Repository For Bug Reporting
Create a Repository From the Template
-----------------------------------
First and foremost, create a repository from this template repository (the one you're in now! 😊 ).

In order to do so, click 'Use this template' and create your repository.

Upload your desired code into the new repository, or alternatively you can also choose to do so directly into the Codespace (we will see how to do this in a later step).

Once creating the desired repository, press `.` (period key) from the main repository page to switch over to dev mode. 

Create a Codespace
------------------
Within dev mode, by clicking the 'Debug and Run' button you can create a new Codespace.

If you haven't already done so, you can import your code from your personal files by clicking File > Open File.

Inside Codespaces
------------------
Once you're inside Codespaces with your desired code, you can edit, run and debug it.

If you have made changes to your code, by clicking on 'Source Control' you can directly stage, commit and push them into the repository.

By clicking the '+' you can stage your changes.

To commit the changes, enter a message and click the check mark. This button will automatically commit straight into the master branch.

Report a Bug
------------------
Now that your repository is ready, click [here](https://github.com/ent/ent/issues/new/choose) to submit an issue on the ent/ent repository.   

Within your issue give some context and link your new repository, and you're done!
